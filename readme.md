## Animal Crossing Music
Just a fun Chrome extension for playing Animal Crossing's music in the background while you work or play or do whatever it is you do with your browser. Updates in real-time whenever a new hour rolls around, and informs you via an optional desktop notification and customizable town tune.

## Progress

### Achieved
Redid all New Leaf Loops with Original files  
(Fixed 1pm track still need to upload the edith though)  
K.K. Slider now plays : from 8pm to 12am / all the time / never  
Added Changelog  
Settings now auto-save  
Added New Leaf Rainy day option and did all the loops  
Customizable Town Chime on every hour change  
Added the PAL equivalent of City Folk to the title (less confusion) (Credit: Google user

Fade-in Fade-out before switching tracks  

### Sought improvements
1.  **Music on day of certain events (Halloween, Guy Fawkes, Christmas, ...)**  

2. **Enable the user to either choose Live K.K. songs or Aircheck songs**  
[Check Issue](https://github.com/JdotCarver/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension/issues/4)

3. **Fix the Download size**  
_This extension is already big and isn't going to get smaller. (We need a solution of some sort to bypass Chrome's questionnable download manager and make the user's experience better)_   

4. **<s>Add loop points support in order to keep the intro of certain tracks that I cut out for the smoothest transition</s>**

5. **Add sound tones to the town tune previsualizer to more closely ressemble the one in the original game**  

6. **<s>Dynamic Music according to local weather</s>**  
[Check Issue](https://github.com/JdotCarver/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension/issues/5)

7. **Add an option for ambient sounds while the music is playing**  
_20% to 30% of the current volume would be pretty sweet, a separate volume slider would be even better. Contact me if you want me to get the sound files prepped._

8. **Alternate icon(s) in browser**  
_Contact me if you want the icon files prepped_
 
9. **(Redo New Leaf Snow loops)**  
*especially 4PM*  
*That will be in suspense until loop points are organized*

10.  **(Actually adding City Folk Rainy and Snowy Tracks!)**  
_This too_

13. **Hire an artist for UI design?**  
*Just thinking about it, would be a nice addition to colorize the interface a bit.*  

14. **Firefox and Opera Compatibility**  
*Preferably when the extension is close to finalized*
